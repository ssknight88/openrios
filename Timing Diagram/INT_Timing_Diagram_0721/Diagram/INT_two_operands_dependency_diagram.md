Source caselist: `Caselist/INT/INT_two_operands_dependency_caselist.md`

Generated under L5 reader-facing rules. P1 cases above show new ISQ payload construction; P2 cases below show resident-entry FU-input MUX forwarding. P1 source-resolution is normalized to T6 in the legacy figures, while P2 resident-entry source-ready is normalized to T8 in the appended figures.

These cases complement the P1 MUX figures above. The dependent instruction is already resident in ISQ; T8 is the observed P2 FU-input MUX cycle where current P3 forwarding and/or stored `entry.rs_data` make the operands usable. `P4 Commit CDB` is not a P2 MUX source. Immediate operands are already carried in the resident payload and are covered by `Stored Ready in ISQ`.
